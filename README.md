# Gymnasium-Tools

The name of our project is “Gymnasium Tools” which is a responsive website with an admin dashboard. In this project, we have used  html/css for front end, php for backend and lastly mysql as database system. We can use the website as a customer as well as the admin. Firstly, a customer needs to register an account for him so that he can login to the website afterwards. People can easily buy any kind of gym equipment from the website. They can choose the cash on delivery option and also use their credit card or bkash to place the order. After placing the order, the admin can review the order and take necessary steps afterwards. We have added different features in our project. Let’s describe those features one by one.
